Moar Filter Extension Configs
by leatherneck6017

This package of configs will add additional filters to the VAB and SPH. The size filters go from 0.625 to 30 meters.

To install, simply unzip the GameData folder to your KSP installation directory.

Let me know if any issues are found.

NOTE: The Filter Extensions mod is required for these configs to work. Get it here: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168456-15-filter-extensions-no-localization/
