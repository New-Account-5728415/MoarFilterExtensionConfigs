Changelog:

1.0.5.2
	- Fixed missing closing bracket in 1.875 config

1.0.5.1
	- Seperate "coupling" into Adapter, Decoupler, Docking Port, and Multi-Coupler subcategories.
	- Add file to fix incorrect Squad bulkheads. Currently only 1.875 heat shield, will add more as I find them.

1.0.5
	- Add subcategories for cargo and robotics. ** Robotics not showing, FE needs new code? **

1.0.4.1
	- Fixed wrong link for version check.
	- Fixed a typo in folder name.
	- Added Changelog.txt
	
1.0.4
	- Added 0.35m size filter and corresponding icon.
	- Converted icons to DDS format.
	
1.0.3
	- Updated folder name to be more in line with normal naming schema. If you are installing this manually, be sure to delete the old folder!
	- Added version file so that AVC can check for updates.
	
1.0.2
	- Added a check to prevent filter from showing old Squad parts that are somehow still in the game.
		These parts were "replaced" by squad by changing the original part categories to "none". But FE does not differentiate without being told to do so in a config file.
	- Added a config to fix invalid categories on a few Squad parts. Now they will show up in the proper sub-category for their size.

1.0
	- Initial release.
